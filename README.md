# Pathfinding-Demo
This project is an anthology of pathfinding methods


I'll implement 3 or 4 different pathfinding algorithms, starting with A* 
  (I plan to also do Theta*/Lazy Theta* and Jump Point Search)
  
* The app will display the time each algorithm took, as well as its fitness (number of steps taken)
* Users will be able to switch between algorithms on the fly
* Users can move the bot's start and end point and change where obstacles are to see how each algorithm differs
* Rendering will be done using canvas (maybe 2D webGL for speed?) and vanilla JS


# Implementation Timeline:

## Day 1:
* Decide on rendering library
* Setup page for drawing
* Get user input for adding walls

## Day 2:
* Setup for abstraction of algorithm implementations
* API for algorithms to render steps with
* Line drawing
* Start control panel (placeholder content)
* Start first algorithm if there's time

## Day 3:
* Finish first algorithm
* Finish control panel

## Day 4: 
* More algorithms!
* Performance reports!
* Host on gh-pages
