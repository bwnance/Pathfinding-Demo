# Pathfinding-Demo
This project is an anthology of pathfinding method


I'll implement 3 or 4 different pathfinding algorithms, starting with A* 
  (I plan to also do Theta*/Lazy Theta* and Jump Point Search)
  
* The app will display the time each algorithm took, as well as its' fitness (number of steps taken)
* Users will be able to switch between algorithms on the fly
* Users can move the bot's start and end point and change where obstacles are to see how each algorithm differs
* Rendering will be done using canvas (maybe 2D webGL for speed?) and vanilla JS
